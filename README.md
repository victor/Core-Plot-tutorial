This is my Core Plot tutorial. It is a git repository consisting of two main branches, `master`, which contains the Xcode project, and `gh-pages`, which is a jekyll project that thanks to the GitHub pages functionality ends up as a website at http://victor.github.com/Core-Plot-tutorial/.

The tutorial is intended for publication both at my personal website and at the NSCoders Spain website (http://nscoders.org/) but will also be available at GitHub. Feel free to open issues there to suggest changes or file bugs.
